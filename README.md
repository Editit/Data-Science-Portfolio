# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes.

## Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling 
(i) [Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/Editit/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Bike%20rental%20Prediction): A model to predict the number of bikes rented on a given day based on several environmental and seasonal settings. Generated and analysed  the most useful features and criterias responsible for people renting bikes.

(ii)[Cristiano Ronaldo Scoring a Goal](https://github.com/Editit/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Cristiano%20Ronaldo%20Goal%20Scoring%20Probability): There are many factors that stops Christiano Ronaldo from Scoring a Goal, getting all those things on point using that messy data and then using Logistic Regression to predict the probability of Ronaldo scoring a goal given the venue, his positiion and much more important factors.

(iii) [Indian Premier League](https://github.com/Editit/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Indian%20Premier%20League): The most fun thing i have done and most probably that every cricket fan will agree, analysing the whole history of IPL and predicting who is going to win the next season. 

(iv) [User Ad Click Prediction](https://github.com/Editit/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/User%20Ad%20Click%20Prediction): A WNS Competetion dataset, and the toughest for me till now to get insights from. Containing 3 datasets for feature engineering purposes including view_log of users and the item table.



## Data Analysis and Visualisation
(i)[Uberdrives analysis](https://github.com/Editit/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Uber.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis of demand and supply issues that uber have been facing with a short indulging kaggle dataset.
